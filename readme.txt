Just your beautiful Flickr Photostream. In a Justified Grid.

== Description ==

Plugin that allows you to show your Flickr Photostream in your blog. Awesome thumbnails disposition with a **justified grid**, with a Javascript algorithm, for a fast redraw. Various settings to **configure the height of the rows** and the behaviour of the last. You can configure the maximum photos per page, then, you can navigate between various pages. You can configure the plugin to create fixed height rows or to create rows where the height depends on the images. The plugin choose the right resolution for the image, using the Flickr size suffixes (for example, if you decide to justify the last row, the images in the last row can are bigger than the others, so for these photos will be used suffixes to have larger photos).

See a Live Demo in [Miro Mannino's Blog](http://miromannino.it/my-photos)

Remember that this plugin is not an official FlickrÂ® plugin, but just a student's work, any help will be greatly appreciated.
